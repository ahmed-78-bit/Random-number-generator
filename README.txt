This is a simple guessing game using Python.

The program starts with a welcome and asking the user for name.

The user would try to guess the random number generated by the program between 1 to 100. 

The user has 9 tries to guess the correct number.

If the user enters a number out of range (1, 100) the program will account it as a try and the player will continue guessing.

If the user enters an invalid input, the program will ask the user to enter a valid number and  the guess will start over and  a new random number will be generated.

If the player wins and guess the right number, the program will print the result, but if the player loose, the programe will ask to continue play or type " NO " to quit .

the program will print the result of all competitors in a .txt file.
